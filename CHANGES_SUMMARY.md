# TacticoAI Changes Summary - Video Upload & Analysis Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to fix critical issues with video upload and ML analysis on macOS. The system now works correctly on both macOS and Windows.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Video Upload Failed on macOS** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** User could select a video but nothing happened - no upload started.

**Root Cause:** API method name mismatch
- Frontend called: `uploadApi.uploadChunk()`
- Backend had: `uploadApi.uploadVideoChunk()`
- Also, `file.slice()` returns `Blob` not `File`

### 2. **Upload Crashed After 3 Chunks** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Upload failed with "400 Bad Request" after uploading 3 chunks.

**Root Cause:** Trying to create `quick_brief` job type, but database schema only allows `enhanced_analysis`.

### 3. **Enhanced Analysis Failed with KeyError** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** ML analysis crashed immediately with `KeyError: 'number'`.

**Root Cause:** Database field mismatch
- Code accessed: `player['number']`
- Database has: `jersey_number`

### 4. **Premature Job Creation** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Jobs created when match was created (before video upload).

**Root Cause:** `create_match()` endpoint was creating jobs immediately.

### 5. **Race Condition on Upload** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Job processor started before database updates propagated.

**Root Cause:** No delay between database update and job creation.

## Files Modified

### Backend Files

#### 1. `backend/main.py`
**Changes:**
- **Line 335-343**: Removed premature job creation from `create_match()` endpoint
- **Line 533-534**: Removed `quick_brief` job type (unsupported by schema)
- **Line 550-590**: Added race condition fixes:
  - Consolidated database updates
  - Added 300ms propagation delay
  - Added duplicate job check
  - Better error handling

**Why:** Ensures jobs are only created after video uploads complete, prevents race conditions.

```python
# BEFORE: Job created immediately when match created
job_result = supabase.table("jobs").insert(job_data).execute()

# AFTER: No job until video uploaded
return {
    "match_id": match_id,
    "job_id": None,  # Created after upload
    "status": "created"
}
```

#### 2. `backend/job_processor.py`
**Changes:**
- **Line 101-113**: Added safety check to skip jobs without uploaded videos
- **Line 122-140**: Added retry logic with 2-second delay for database replication lag

**Why:** Handles edge cases where job starts before video is ready, provides graceful error recovery.

```python
# Check if video uploaded before processing
if upload_status != "uploaded":
    logger.warning(f"Job skipped: video not uploaded yet")
    self._update_job_status(job_id, "cancelled", 0)
    return
```

#### 3. `backend/video_analysis/examples/soccer/supabase_database_manager.py`
**Changes:**
- **Line 94**: Fixed `player['number']` ‚Üí `player['jersey_number']`
- **Line 160**: Fixed `player['number']` ‚Üí `player['jersey_number']`

**Why:** Match database schema field names to prevent KeyError during player data loading.

```python
# BEFORE: Wrong field name
key = (player['team_id'], player['number'])  # KeyError!

# AFTER: Correct field name
key = (player['team_id'], player['jersey_number'])  # Works!
```

#### 4. `backend/seed_data.py` (NEW FILE)
**Purpose:** Creates demo teams and players in database.

**Why:** Needed because teams must exist before uploading matches. Creates:
- UOP Tigers (Orange/Black)
- UC California Bears (Blue/Gold)
- 5 sample players per team

**Usage:** `python backend/seed_data.py`

### Frontend Files

#### 5. `frontend/lib/api.ts`
**Changes:**
- **Line 99-102**: Added `getTeamMatches()` method (alias for `getByTeamId`)
- **Line 150-160**: Added `getJob()` method (alias for `getJobStatus`)
- **Line 224-256**: Added `uploadChunk()` method that accepts `Blob` type

**Why:** Frontend was calling methods that didn't exist. The new `uploadChunk()` method handles `Blob` from `file.slice()`.

```typescript
// NEW: Accepts Blob because file.slice() returns Blob
async uploadChunk(
    chunk: File | Blob,  // Not just File!
    chunkIndex: number,
    totalChunks: number,
    matchId: string,
    teamId: string
): Promise<...> {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', chunk);
    // ... upload logic
}
```

## Technical Details

### Upload Flow (Fixed)
1. **User creates match** ‚Üí Match record created, NO job
2. **User selects video** ‚Üí File chunked into 10MB pieces
3. **Chunks upload** ‚Üí Each saved to `video_storage/{team_id}/{match_id}/chunks/`
4. **Last chunk completes** ‚Üí Database updated + 300ms delay
5. **Job created** ‚Üí Enhanced analysis job queued
6. **Job processor picks up** ‚Üí Verifies video uploaded, loads players
7. **ML analysis runs** ‚Üí YOLOv8 detects players/ball, tracks movement
8. **Results saved** ‚Üí Analysis data + video output saved

### Database Schema Alignment
```sql
-- Players table uses jersey_number, not number
CREATE TABLE players (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  position TEXT NOT NULL,
  jersey_number INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- <-- This field!
  ...
);
```

### Race Condition Solution
```python
# 1. Update database
final_update = supabase.table("matches").update({
    "upload_status": "uploaded",
    "video_chunks_total": total_chunks
}).eq("id", match_id).execute()

# 2. Wait for propagation
time.sleep(0.3)  # 300ms for Supabase replication

# 3. Create job
job_result = supabase.table("jobs").insert(job_data).execute()
```
