# Database Field Name Fixes - Complete Audit

## Summary
Completed comprehensive audit of `supabase_database_manager.py` to ensure all field accesses match the database schema defined in `MAIN_SCHEMA.sql`.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ❌ **Issue: Field Name Mismatch in Players Table**

**Problem:**
- Database schema uses: `jersey_number` (line 37 in MAIN_SCHEMA.sql)
- Code was using: `player['number']`

**Impact:**
- Caused `KeyError: 'number'` during ML enhanced analysis
- Analysis failed immediately when loading player data
- No ML processing could occur

### ✅ **Fixes Applied**

#### Fix 1: `_load_players()` method (Line 94)
```python
# BEFORE:
key = (player['team_id'], player['number'])

# AFTER:
key = (player['team_id'], player['jersey_number'])
```

#### Fix 2: `assign_tracker_to_jersey()` method (Line 160)
```python
# BEFORE:
'jersey_number': player['number'],

# AFTER:
'jersey_number': player['jersey_number'],
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ All Field Accesses Verified Correct

**Players Table Fields:**
- ✅ `player['id']` - correct
- ✅ `player['team_id']` - correct
- ✅ `player['name']` - correct
- ✅ `player['position']` - correct
- ✅ `player['jersey_number']` - **FIXED**

**Matches Table Fields:**
- ✅ `match['team_id']` - correct

**Teams Table Fields:**
- ✅ `team['id']` - correct
- ✅ `team['name']` - correct
- ✅ `team['theme_colors']` - correct

### ✅ No Issues in Related Files
- `enhanced_supabase_analysis.py` - Uses `jersey_number` correctly
- No other files access player fields incorrectly

## Database Schema Reference

### Players Table (MAIN_SCHEMA.sql lines 32-50)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  position TEXT NOT NULL,
  jersey_number INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (jersey_number > 0 AND jersey_number <= 99),
  avatar_url TEXT,
  stats JSONB DEFAULT '{ ... }'::jsonb,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Note:** The field is `jersey_number`, NOT `number`.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Fixed all field name mismatches
- [x] Verified all table field accesses
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Test video upload with enhanced analysis
- [ ] Verify player data loads correctly
- [ ] Confirm ML analysis completes successfully

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Video upload completes** → All chunks uploaded successfully
2. **Enhanced analysis job created** → Job queued in database
3. **Job processor starts analysis** → Loads player data successfully
4. **ML processing begins** → No more `KeyError: 'number'`
5. **Analysis completes** → Results saved to database

## Next Steps

1. Upload a test video
2. Monitor backend logs for:
   ```
   ✓ Loaded {N} players from database
   ✓ Mapped tracker {id} → Jersey #{number}
   ```
3. Verify analysis completes without KeyError

**Status:** ✅ All database field mismatches fixed and verified
