TacticoAI - Quick Changes Summary for macOS Upload Fix
=====================================================

HEY! Here are all the changes I made to fix video upload on macOS:

FILES CHANGED:
1. backend/main.py - Fixed job creation and race conditions
2. backend/job_processor.py - Added safety checks and retry logic
3. backend/video_analysis/examples/soccer/supabase_database_manager.py - Fixed field names
4. backend/seed_data.py - NEW FILE for creating demo teams
5. frontend/lib/api.ts - Added missing methods for upload
6. frontend/hooks/useChunkedUpload.ts - Minor fix

MAIN ISSUES FIXED:
==================

Issue #1: Video upload didn't start
- Frontend called uploadChunk() but API had uploadVideoChunk()
- Fixed: Added uploadChunk() method that accepts Blob type

Issue #2: Upload crashed after 3 chunks
- Tried to create "quick_brief" job but DB only allows "enhanced_analysis"
- Fixed: Removed quick_brief job creation

Issue #3: ML analysis failed with KeyError: 'number'
- Code used player['number'] but DB has jersey_number field
- Fixed: Changed to player['jersey_number'] in 2 places

Issue #4: Jobs created too early
- Jobs were created when match was created (before upload!)
- Fixed: Jobs now only created AFTER video upload completes

Issue #5: Race condition
- Job started before database updates finished
- Fixed: Added 300ms delay + retry logic

WHAT TO DO:
===========
1. Pull these changes: git pull origin main
2. Run seed script: cd backend && python seed_data.py
3. Restart everything (kill ports 8000 and 5173 first)
4. Test video upload - should work now!

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
=================
✓ Upload works on macOS
✓ No more KeyError crashes
✓ Proper job timing
✓ Better error handling
✓ Cross-platform compatible

That's it! The system should now work perfectly on both macOS and Windows.
Let me know if you hit any issues.
